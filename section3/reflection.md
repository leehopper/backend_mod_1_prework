## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

Overall I think I have a good the growth mindset, especially when it comes to technology. It's why I am attending Turing in the first place, because I want to learn and continue to learn software development. I am excited to tackle it with an "all in" mindset, and Turing's emphasis on life long learning skills teaching yourself is one of the big reasons I chose the school

This is how I have pursued things my whole career. Shortly after college, I came on as the Chief Operating Officer of a start up public relations and digital advertising firm, where I had to learn and create many elements of the company and our work as we went. So this mindset was essential to my success during my 4 years in that role. After that, I spent the last two years working for myself, always having to learn and grow and learn on my own when I didn't understand something.

Where I struggle with the growth mindset is in areas where I where the subject matter or task is does not play to my strengths or interests. In past, I tended to avoid those things since I "wasn't good at them". I think this is an area I have grown on in the past few years (yes, I have grown in my growth mindset...) so I have seen the success of never being afraid to pursue or learn new things in places I did not always do so.

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.

1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
