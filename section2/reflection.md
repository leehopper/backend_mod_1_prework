## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

I am probably on the wait too long side of the problem. I have worked for myself for the past 2 years, so I have gotten good at figuring out things on my own because I often have no other choice. So I did have to spend the 2-3 hours researching a solution to certain problems. That being said, I realize I simply won't have the time to do that at Turing given my overall workload and deadlines, so I will adapt and ask my questions sooner. It will also be helpful to be pursuing things in an overall team approach, then that makes a big difference.Â
