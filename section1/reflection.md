## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

This piece resonated with me well. From this list, I already read a lot and definitely agree that it serves as a "mind exercise". Teaching others what you know was another strong point. Whenever I teach an individual or a group something, it ends up teaching me more than them, especially if you are teaching something multiple times.

I need to be better about taking breaks. I tend to give a task a wall of concentration without stopping for several hours. That doesn't help me learn as well as I could, but the challenge of taking breaks is that it can be difficult to get yourself back going on something and not procrastinating.  Where once I get going, it is easier for me to stay focused. So this is a more difficult habit for me to break, but worthwhile to pursue especially while I am at Turing and trying to learn a lot of information in a very short amount of time.

They mention taking care of your brain with healthy food, but I would add that you should take care of your overall body with exercise and other healthy physical habits. My brain works better when I am exercising, and certainly learns better.
