# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby section1/exercises/variables.rb`

# Example: Write code that saves your name to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
name = "Harry Potter"
p name

# Write code that saves the string 'Dobby' to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
house_elf = "Dobby"
puts house_elf

# Write code that saves the string 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!'
# and prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
dobby_quote = "Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!"
puts dobby_quote

# Write code that adds 2 to the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
students = 22
students = students + 2
p students

# Write code that subracts 2 from the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
students = students - 2
p students


# YOU DO:
# Declare three variables, named `first_name`, `is_hungry` and `number_of_pets`.
# Store the appropriate data types in each.
# print all three variables to the terminal.

first_name = "Lee"
is_hungry = false
number_of_pets = 1

puts "My name is #{first_name}."
puts "True or false that I am hungry? #{is_hungry}"
puts "I have #{number_of_pets} pet(s)."

# IN WORDS:
# How did you decide to use the data type you did for each of the three variables above?
# Explain.

# For 'first_name', I chose a string since it was asking for text.
# For 'is_hungry', I chose a boolean since it was a yes/no question.
# For 'number of pets', I chose an integer since I have an exact number and no decimal needed.

# YOU DO:
# Re-assign the values to the three variables from the previous challenge to different values (but same data type).
# print all three variables to the terminal.

first_name = "Vern"
is_hungry = true
number_of_pets = 5

puts "My name is #{first_name}."
puts "True or false that I am hungry? #{is_hungry}"
puts "I have #{number_of_pets} pet(s)."

# YOU DO:
# Using the variables below, print the total number of snacks to the terminal:
healthy_snacks = 6;
junk_food_snacks = 8;

puts "Total snacks: #{healthy_snacks + junk_food_snacks}"

# FINAL CHECK
#-------------------

# Did you run this file in your terminal to make sure everything printed out to the terminal
  # as you would expect?
